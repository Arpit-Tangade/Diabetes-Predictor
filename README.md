A machine learning project that predicts whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on health data. This model is built using the popular Pima Indians Diabetes dataset and aims to demonstrate how AI can be used in early disease detection.
This project focuses on building a predictive model using health-related attributes like glucose level, BMI, insulin, age, etc., to determine the likelihood of diabetes in an individual.

Itâ€™s a simple but powerful demonstration of how data science + machine learning can contribute to preventive healthcare.
